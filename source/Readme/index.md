Welcome to my personal space on the web! I'm Yuangang Li, a passionate software developer and infrastructure engineer based in Los Angeles, CA. With a background rooted in Computer Science and hands-on experience in the dynamic field of cloud computing and AI, I thrive on coding, problem-solving, and continuous learning.

## Education üéì
I'm currently expanding my horizons as a Master's student in Computer Science at the University of Southern California, an experience that has significantly broadened my theoretical knowledge and practical skills in this domain. My academic journey began at Beijing City University, where I earned my BSc in Software Engineering, specializing in Cloud Computing. Standing out in my class, I graduated with a remarkable GPA, landing in the top 1%.

## How I Work üíª
My expertise pivots around several key aspects of tech development:

Backend Development: Well-versed in Java, Golang, Python, and Node.js, I can seamlessly create, optimize, and manage server-side applications.
Frontend Craftsmanship: Using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, and AngularJS, I breathe life into user-friendly interfaces and engaging web components.
DevOps & Cloud Operations: Proficient in tools like Kubernetes, Docker, AWS, and GCP, I ensure smooth deployment, reliable cloud infrastructures, and efficient workflow orchestrations.
AI & Deep Learning: My journey at USC iLab Laboratory honed my skills in MLOps, deepening my understanding of machine learning frameworks and enhancing my capability to contribute to advanced AI projects.
## Professional Path üöÄ
My work experience has been a blend of development and research, pushing boundaries, and delivering products and solutions that resonate with end-user needs and business objectives. I've lent my skills to various projects, ranging from developing AI-driven applications at Xiaoniu Translations to spearheading infrastructure management at SenseTime, China's first listed AI company. One of my notable contributions is the creation of "RocketMQ as a Service," a project that significantly accelerated service creation efficiency.

In research, my stint at the Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences, allowed me to delve into web-based automated testing tools, streamlining the testing process, and enhancing productivity.

## Side Projects & Recognition üèÖ
Beyond my formal roles, I love getting involved in side projects. They‚Äôve ranged from creating a full-stack event searching system, 'EventMaster', to leading an award-winning analysis platform that innovatively informs university major development decisions. These experiences have not only satisfied my creative and intellectual curiosity but also earned me prestigious recognitions, including a "National Level Innovative Excellence Project" award.
