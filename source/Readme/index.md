### Hi Welcome üëã
üëã Welcome to my personal space! I'm Yuangang Li, a *Computer Science master's student at USC*, specializing in **AI** and **Cloud Computing**. As a dedicated **FullStack** Developer and **Infrastructure** Engineer, I embrace challenges and innovation in these dynamic fields.

2023 With [Iordanis Fostiropoulos](https://iordanis.me/), I am involved in the research and development of [Ablator](/Projects/#ablator), a **distributed execution framework** for **hyperparameter tuning** and **ablation experiments** for **machine learning**, at the [DeepUSC Lab](https://deep.usc.edu/) at USC.

And work with Prof. Zhao ([Yue Zhao](https://viterbi-web.usc.edu/~yzhao010/)) to develop OpenAD, **an integrated open-source ecosystem for anomaly detection**, in the ASAP Lab at **USC**.

**Contributor** to the [apache/rocketmq-operator](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq-operator) and [USC/DeepUSC/ablator](https://github.com/fostiropoulos/ablator)

### Education üéì
I'm currently expanding my horizons as a **Master's** student in **Computer Science** at **the University of Southern California**, an experience that has significantly broadened my theoretical knowledge and practical skills in this domain. My academic journey began at Beijing City University, where I earned my BSc in Software Engineering, specializing in Cloud Computing. Standing out in my class, I graduated with a remarkable GPA, landing in the top 1%.

### How I Work üíª
My expertise pivots around several key aspects of tech development:

**Backend Development:** Well-versed in **Java**, **Golang**, Python, and Node.js, I can seamlessly create, optimize, and manage server-side applications.
**Frontend Craftsmanship:** Using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, and AngularJS, I breathe life into user-friendly interfaces and engaging web components.
**DevOps & Cloud Operations:** Proficient in tools like **Kubernetes**, **Docker**, AWS, and GCP, I ensure smooth deployment, reliable cloud infrastructures, and efficient workflow orchestrations.
**AI & Deep Learning:** My journey at USC iLab Laboratory honed my skills in **MLOps**, deepening my understanding of machine learning frameworks and enhancing my capability to contribute to advanced AI projects.
### Professional Path üöÄ
My work experience has been a blend of **development and research**, pushing boundaries, and delivering products and solutions that resonate with end-user needs and business objectives. I've lent my skills to various projects, ranging from developing AI-driven applications at Xiaoniu Translations to spearheading infrastructure management at **SenseTime**, China's first listed AI company. One of my notable contributions is the creation of "RocketMQ as a Service," a project that significantly accelerated service creation efficiency.

In research, my stint at **the Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences**, allowed me to delve into web-based automated testing tools, streamlining the testing process, and enhancing productivity.

### Side Projects & Recognition üèÖ
Beyond my formal roles, I love getting involved in side projects. They‚Äôve ranged from creating a full-stack event searching system, 'EventMaster', to leading an award-winning analysis platform that innovatively informs university major development decisions. These experiences have not only satisfied my creative and intellectual curiosity but also earned me prestigious recognitions, including a "**National Level Innovative Excellence Project**" award.
